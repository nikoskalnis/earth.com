       Have you ever wondered how far the Earth is from the Sun? Or what makes Earth unique compared to other planets in our solar system, and why it's so perfect for supporting life?
       Have you ever wondered what would happen to Earth if its Moon were to suddenly disappear? If you don't have the answer, get it here!
       Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and its surface area is 510.1 million square kilometers. Here is an image that shows the distance from the Earth to the Sun:

      The size and distance may not be accurate in this photo but the position is! This photo proves that the Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and we'll right now
      get into the reason for its ability to sustain life. This might also explain aliens too. So, imagine this. There is an alien species, and their planet was destroyed by a collision with another
      planet somehow. So, they needed to find a new planet. The planet the first spaceship tried looked nice and warm, but it was too hot and they shriveled up to death. The planet the second spaceship tried seemed nice and cool, but can you
      guess what happened? Yup, they didn't make it due to hypothermia. But they needed to find a new planet, so one day, a third spaceship landed on a planet that seemed warm, but not as hot as the first planet, and it was just right. So
      they settled in, started a family, downloaded all the apps and lived happily ever after. Here is a graphical representation of the experiment:
